## me
Hi. My name is Tonk1e. I know nothing about writing operating systems, and that's why I decided to write an operating system.
## the OS
So, at the moment it isn't very interesting, and has basically no functionality. I have only written the very basics, which is just about enough to let it boot. I was using grub as a bootloader, but I have started to write my own, which will probably be very basic.
## the bootloader
The bootloader is most likely going to be very simple, to the point where there are no options at all, and it will just boot straight into the os, as no one else will be using my bootloader for their os.
